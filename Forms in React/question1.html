  form data is handled by React through the use of hooks such as the useState hook.

2)Uncontrolled Components:

"controlled component" 
   to a form input element where the value is entirely managed by the React component's state
   Controlled components are form elements (like input , textarea , or select ) that are managed by React state.

   An uncontrolled component in React is one that stores its own state internally and 
   does not control its value through the React state mechanism.
