Question 2: Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and componentbased architecture.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, 
particularly for single-page applications. 
Its core principles include the Virtual DOM, Component-Based Architecture

Virtual Dom:The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, its representation of the actual DOM. 
           Instead of directly manipulating the DOM,
           React uses the Virtual DOM to make updates more efficient.
           
Component-Based Architecture:React encourages breaking down the user interface into small, 
           reusable, and self-contained pieces called components. 
           Each component represents a specific part of the UI, such as a button, a form, or a navigation bar.
