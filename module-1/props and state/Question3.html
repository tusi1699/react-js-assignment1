<!-- Why is this.setState() used in class components, and how does it work -->

use the setState() method to change the state object 
it will ensure that the component knows its been updated
and calls the render() method (and all the other lifecycle methods).
In class components, this.setState is used to update the component's state. 
 React schedules a re-render of the component whenever the state is updated.

 this.setState({ key: newValue });
