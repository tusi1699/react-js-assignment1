Discuss the importance of using curly braces {} in JSX expressions.

JSX lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file, keeping rendering logic and content in the same place. 
Sometimes you will want to add a little JavaScript logic or reference a dynamic property inside that markup. 
In this situation, you can use curly braces in your JSX to open a window to JavaScript.


import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
var a=10;
var b=20;
var c=a+b;
var d=a-b;
var e=a/b;
var f=a*b;
createRoot(document.getElementById("id-name")).render(
    <StrictMode>
    <p>The additions of numbers is :{c} <br /> 
        The substractions of numbers is :{d} <br/> 
        The divisions of numbers is :{e} <br /> 
        The multiplications of numbers is :{f}</p>
      </StrictMode>
