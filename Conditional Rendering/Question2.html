Explain how if-else, ternary operators, and && (logical AND) are used in JSXfor
conditional rendering.

For simple conditions where you want to render a component based on a single boolean expression, 
the && operator might be more concise

1.If-Else:

let content;
if (condition) {
    content = <ComponentA />;
} else {
    content = <ComponentB />;
}
return content;

2.Ternary Operator (? :):
Use this inline for concise conditional rendering.

return condition ? <ComponentA /> : <ComponentB />;

3.Logical AND (&&):
Use it for rendering something only if the condition is true

return condition && <ComponentA />;
